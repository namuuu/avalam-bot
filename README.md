# L.A.N.A: an Avalam bot.

This project is a little bot that plays Avalam, that was made for a school project at IG2I, in 2021. This project compted against multiple opponents from multiple other groups and ended up **3rd**.

This bot uses the Min-Max algorithm (we were one of the only teams to successfully do it), however, the bot wasn't as smart as we expected when jauging the score of a board, but it could definitely be improved under your wing !

# Installation

As it was made for a shcool project, the main components wasn't made by us. I will not explain how to use it, and let the full comprehension of the code to the future IG2I groups so they can get better each year.

Please contact us if you ever use this bot, so we are aware that LANA continues to live !
